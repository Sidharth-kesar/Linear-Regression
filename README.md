# Linear Regression on Salary Data

This repository contains a simple implementation of **Linear Regression** using Python and scikit-learn.  
The project demonstrates how to build, train, test, and visualize a linear regression model on a real-world salary dataset.

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict **salary** based on **years of experience** using a supervised machine learning approach.

The notebook walks through:
- Importing and understanding the dataset
- Splitting data into training and testing sets
- Training a Linear Regression model
- Making predictions
- Visualizing results for both training and test data

If you don’t understand *why* each step exists, reread the notebook. Regression doesn’t reward blind copying.

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

- Simple Linear Regression
- Train-Test Split
- Model Training using `sklearn`
- Prediction on unseen data
- Data Visualization using Matplotlib

This is **not** multivariable regression.  
This is **not** magic.  
This is straight-line math wearing a Python costume.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- scikit-learn

## 📂 Dataset

- **Dataset Name:** Salary Data
- **Source:** Kaggle  
- **Features:**
  - `YearsExperience` (Independent Variable)
  - `Salary` (Dependent Variable)

Make sure the dataset path is correctly set before running the notebook.

## ⚙️ Workflow

1. Import required libraries
2. Load the salary dataset
3. Separate independent (`x`) and dependent (`y`) variables
4. Split the dataset into training and testing sets
5. Train the Linear Regression model
6. Predict salary values
7. Visualize:
   - Training set results
   - Test set results

Each step exists for a reason. If you remove one, the model collapses. Try it.

## 📊 Output Visualizations

- Scatter plot of actual data points
- Regression line fitted on training data
- Comparison of predicted vs actual values on test data

If your graph is a mess, that’s not “noise”. That’s you missing a concept.
